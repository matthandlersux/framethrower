We do all communication of time in seconds.

For the scrubber,
	We need to be able to instantiate with a given:
		width
		height
	We need to be able to send message:
		seek (time) -- tell the player to seek to a specific time
	We need to be able to receive an event:
		loadedDuration (time) -- as the video loads, it sends messages back to the browser about the number of seconds that are loaded (this is lower priority than seek)

For the player,
	We need to be able to instantiate the player with a given:
		width
		height
		start -- in seconds, where to start playing the video
		duration -- in seconds
	For now, the player should have the built-in controls for play/pause. You can just use an out-of-the-box video player.
