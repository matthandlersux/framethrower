Advanced queries:
Syntax to describe queries
Code to turn syntax into Expr

Return:
Expr can return 'wildcard' results all together in a set
How else? Can it return a tree structure matching the query structure with wildcards filled in?

Advanced query syntax:
XPath based?

Infon:
<in, realLife, <relation, arg1, arg2, arg3>>
	infon without context should only match infon true in some context?


Wildcard: *

Wildcard with constraints (read : as 'such that'):
[a: <relation, *, a>] (Object with certain infon true about it)
Keyword constraints:
[a: descendant(a, realLife, in)] (a such that a is descendant of realLife using the in relation)
[a: descendant(a, realLife, *)] (a such that a is descendant of realLife using any infons)
