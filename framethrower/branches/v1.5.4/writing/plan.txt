component to go from set (add/remove) to unit (set)

H - transform - gets applied to a bunch of units by name
	so like a component in that way
		can normal components just have named "in" and "out" parameters?
		
	can output a component applied to something ??? higher order
		ie: for taking in inputs, then doing queries on the objects and feeding into another component
		like union
		a generic way to garbage collect this

make a "tensor" component that takes named units and outputs a single unit

make an xml interface



interfaces
	unit
		set
	set
		add
		remove
	list
		insert
		update
		remove
	xml




endcaps are the only thing that need to get garbage collected

solution: create endcaps in ambients
	each instantiated processor gets an ambient to make endcaps



boxes can exist on a client or on the server.
	could split based on
		processing amount
		amount of sharing of output between clients
		amount of bandwidth input and output
		constraint: some stuff needs to be on client (UI) or server (database)



finish up kernel representation, maybe some abstraction?
figure out xml updating, thunk system



exercise:
	XML function rep -> component that takes in the parameters and spits out the XML (with unevaluated thunks)
